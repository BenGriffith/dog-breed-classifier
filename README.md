Machine Learning Nanodegree - Project 4

In this Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project, I learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
